Priority queues Open and Closed begin empty. 
Put S into Open with priority f(s) = g(s) + h(s)
Is Open empty?
	Yes? No solution. 
	No. Remove node with lowest f(n). Call it n. 
	If n is a goal, 
		stop and report success (for pathfinding, return the path)
	Otherwise, 
		expand n. 
			For each n’ in successors(n)
				Let f’ = g(n’) + h(n’) = g(n) + cost (n, n’) + h(n’)
				If n’ not seen before or n’ previously expanded with f(n’) > f’ or n’ currently in Open 	with f(n’) > f’ 
						Then place or promote n’ on Open with priority f’
						Else ignore n’
	Place record for n in Closed
